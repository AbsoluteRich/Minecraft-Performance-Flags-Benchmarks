          comma separated list of supported instructions. Compare with subclasses
          of Assembler.InstructionCounter.
graal.AbortOnBenchmarkCounterOverflow = false                            [Boolean]
          Abort VM with SIGILL if benchmark counters controlled by the
          (Generic|Timed|Benchmark)DynamicCounters

          Analysis results statistics file.
graal.ArrayRegionEqualsConstantLimit = 4096                              [Integer]
          Array region equality checks will be evaluated at compile time if the
          receiver is a constant and its length is smaller than this value.
graal.AutomaticReferenceHandling := false                                [Boolean]
          Determines if the reference handling is executed automatically or
          manually.
graal.BenchmarkCounterPrintingCutoff = true                              [Boolean]
          Use a cutoff to print only most significant counters.
graal.BenchmarkCountersDumpDynamic = true                                [Boolean]
          Dump dynamic counters
graal.BenchmarkCountersDumpStatic = false                                [Boolean]
          Dump static counters
graal.BenchmarkCountersFile = null                                        [String]
          File to which benchmark counters are dumped. A CSV format is used if
          the file ends with .csv otherwise a more human readable format is used.
          The fields in the CSV format are: category, group, name, value
graal.BenchmarkDynamicCounters = null                                     [String]
          Turn on the benchmark counters. The format of this option is:

            (err|out),start pattern,end pattern

          Start counting when the start pattern matches on the given stream and stop when the end pattern occurs.
          You can use "~" to match 1 or more digits.
          Examples:

            err, starting =====, PASSED in
            out,Iteration ~ (~s) begins:,Iteration ~ (~s) ends:

          The first pattern matches DaCapo output and the second matches SPECjvm2008 output.

          As a more detailed example, here are the options to use for getting statistics
          about allocations within the DaCapo pmd benchmark:

            -XX:JVMCICounterSize=<value> -XX:-JVMCICountersExcludeCompiler \
            -Dgraal.BenchmarkDynamicCounters="err, starting ====, PASSED in " \
            -Dgraal.ProfileAllocations=true

          The JVMCICounterSize value depends on the granularity of the profiling -
          10000 should be sufficient. Omit JVMCICountersExcludeCompiler to exclude
          counting allocations on the compiler threads.
          The counters can be further configured by the ProfileAllocationsContext option.

          We highly recommend the use of -Dgraal.AbortOnBenchmarkCounterOverflow=true to
          detect counter overflows eagerly.
graal.BootstrapInitializeOnly = false                                    [Boolean]

          The number of compilations allowed for any method before the VM exits
          (a value of 0 means there is no limit).
graal.CompilationExcludePhases = null                                     [String]
          Exclude certain phases from compilation, either unconditionally or with
          a method filter. Multiple exclusions can be specified separated by ':'.
          Phase names are matched as substrings, e.g.:
          CompilationExcludePhases=PartialEscape:Loop=A.*,B.foo excludes
          PartialEscapePhase from all compilations and any phase containing
          'Loop' in its name from compilations of all methods in class A and of
          method B.foo.
graal.CompilationExpirationPeriod = 300                                  [Integer]
          Time limit in seconds before a compilation expires (0 to disable the
          limit). A non-zero value for this option is doubled if assertions are
          enabled and quadrupled if DetailedAsserts is true.
graal.CompilationFailureAction = Silent                                   [String]
          Specifies the action to take when compilation fails.

          The accepted values are:
              Silent  - Print nothing to the console.
               Print  - Print a stack trace to the console.
            Diagnose* - Retry the compilation with extra diagnostics.
              ExitVM  - Same as Diagnose except that the VM process exits after retrying.

          * If "Diagnose" is set compilation will be retried with extra diagnostics enabled including dumping (see file:doc-files/DumpHelp.txt).
            In such a scenario DiagnoseDumpLevel can be used to specify the dump level (DebugContext dump levels) accordingly.

          Specifies how many details are printed for certain diagnostic thunks,
          e.g.: 'DumpThreads:1,DumpRegisters:2'. A value of 1 will result in the
          maximum amount of information, higher values will print less
          information. By default, the most detailed output is enabled for all
          diagnostic thunks. Wildcards (*) are supported in the name of the
          diagnostic thunk.
graal.DisableExplicitGC = false                                          [Boolean]

          simple name is 'String'. You can append ':verbose' at the end of the
          filter value to print out disabled intrinsics as they are encountered
          during compilation (e.g., 'String.equals:verbose').
graal.DivertParameterReturningMethod = true                              [Boolean]

graal.Dump = null                                                         [String]
          Filter pattern for specifying scopes in which dumping is enabled.

          A filter is a list of comma-separated terms of the form:

            <pattern>[:<level>]

          If <pattern> contains a "*" or "?" character, it is interpreted as a glob pattern.
          Otherwise, it is interpreted as a substring. If <pattern> is empty, it
          matches every scope. If :<level> is omitted, it defaults to 1. The term
          ~<pattern> is a shorthand for <pattern>:0 to disable a debug facility for a pattern.

          The default log level is 0 (disabled). Terms with an empty pattern set
          the default log level to the specified value. The last
          matching term with a non-empty pattern selects the level specified. If
          no term matches, the log level is the default level. A filter with no
          terms matches every scope with a log level of 1.

          Examples of debug filters:
          ---------
            (empty string)

            Matches any scope with level 1.
          ---------
            :1

            Matches any scope with level 1.
          ---------
            *

            Matches any scope with level 1.
          ---------
            CodeGen,CodeInstall

            Matches scopes containing "CodeGen" or "CodeInstall", both with level 1.
          ---------
            CodeGen:2,CodeInstall:1

            Matches scopes containing "CodeGen" with level 2, or "CodeInstall" with level 1.
          ---------
            Outer:2,Inner:0}

            Matches scopes containing "Outer" with log level 2, or "Inner" with log level 0. If the scope
            name contains both patterns then the log level will be 0. This is useful for silencing subscopes.
          ---------
            :1,Dead:2

            Matches scopes containing "Dead" with level 2, and all other scopes with level 1.
          ---------
            Dead:0,:1

            Matches all scopes with level 1, except those containing "Dead".   Note that the location of
            the :1 doesn't matter since it's specifying the default log level so it's the same as
            specifying :1,Dead:0.
          ---------
            Code*

            Matches scopes starting with "Code" with level 1.
          ---------
            Code,~Dead

            Matches scopes containing "Code" but not "Dead", with level 1.

          When this option is not set, logging is enabled at a level of WARNING.
          When this option is set to the empty string, logging is enabled at a level of INFO.
          When this option is set to "disable", logging is disabled entirely.

          Otherwise, this option expects a comma separated list of tag combinations, each with an optional wildcard (*) and level.
          A tag combination without a level is given a default level of INFO.
          Messages with tags that match a given tag combination are set to log at that tag combination's level.
          If a tag combination does not have a wildcard, then only messages with exactly the same tags are matched.
          Otherwise, messages whose tags are a subset of the tag combination are matched.
          Specifying "all" instead of a tag combination matches all tag combinations.
          If more than one tag combination matches a message's tags, the rightmost one will apply.
          Messages with tags that do not have any matching tag combinations are set to log at a default level of WARNING.
          This option is case insensitive.

          Available log levels:
          [trace, debug, info, warning, error, off]

          Available log tags:
          [jfr, system, event, setting, bytecode, parser, metadata, dcmd]

            Class = { package "." } class .

          Glob pattern matching (*, ?) is allowed in all parts of the source pattern.
          The "~" prefix negates the pattern.

          Positive patterns are joined by an "or" operator: "A,B" matches anything
          matched by "A" or "B". Negative patterns are joined by "and not": "~A,~B"
          matches anything not matched by "A" and not matched by "B". "A,~B,~C,D"
          matches anything matched by "A" or "D" and not matched by "B" and not
          matched by "C".

          A set of patterns containing negative patterns but no positive ones contains
          an implicit positive "*" pattern: "~A,~B" is equivalent to "*,~A,~B".

                                   likely to be successfully exploited in an attack.
